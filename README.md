# Interpretability-machine-learning-model-in-stock-market
I'm Nga Vu, a fellow student conducting research on the interpretability of a supervised learning-based bitcoin trading strategy in Lehigh University. I invite you to explore our team website, where you can delve into our intriguing work if it piques your interest.  https://sites.google.com/lehigh.edu/nga-vu-blog/home

In this project, our goal is to understand the model by utilizing some interpretability tools such as LIME, SHAPE, and ELI5. My role was to use the LIME and ELI5, which are included in the code above. 

#Back testing strategy before interpreting it
By incorporating the SMA50 and SMA200 indicators, our team sought to capture essential trends and patterns in the stock market. These indicators enable us to gain valuable insights into the overall direction of stock price movements, enhancing the accuracy of our predictions.
I took the initiative to refine our approach. By adjusting parameters and exploring alternative indicators, I aimed to enhance our predictive capabilities in the stock market. These modifications were undertaken with the goal of achieving more accurate forecasts for future stock prices.

For more information, please take a look at my personal blog for LIME and ELI5 (Week 5), and our group blog for the overall project. Thank you very much!
